This has allowed employers to largely overcome the restrictions they encounter when recruiting non-EU workers that do not currently apply to EU workers.</p> <p>Non-EU workers are therefore playing a key, complementary role in the UK workforce; especially in sectors such as healthcare. Looking ahead, the data may herald a structural shift towards hiring more non-EU workers when restrictions are loosened for non-EU workers and tightened for EU workers from 2021.”</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Davies </strong>also suggests that this trend is keeping wage growth down:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>“The relatively sharp growth in the number of non-UK born workers in employment has also acted as a brake on salaries rising more quickly; especially in shortage occupations.

          "body": "<p>Theresa May’s Brexit talks with Labour have been criticised as a “blind alley” as she came under intense pressure from 14 senior party figures to abandon the idea of a cross-party pact.</p> <p>The former defence secretary Michael Fallon said the talks should be stopped, after he joined 12 other former cabinet ministers and Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the 1922 Committee, in warning No 10 against any deal that involved a customs union.</p> <p>Fallon, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/01/michael-fallon-quits-as-defence-secretary\">forced to resign by May in 2017</a> for inappropriate behaviour towards women, said it would be better to stay in the EU than sign up to a customs union – a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/03/grounds-for-hope-in-customs-union-talks-with-labour-says-hunt\">key demand of Labour</a>.</p> <p>“This is a blind alley taking us into a customs union,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We said we would leave a customs union very clearly at the time of the election. If you go into a customs union you can’t start pursuing independent trade deals.</p> <p>“Far better to start concentrating on the other side which is the arrangements in Northern Ireland. The talks are clearly not getting anywhere. If they are going to include permanent membership of the customs union, then frankly we would be better off staying in the EU.”</p> <p>May’s cabinet and Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet are both due to take stock of the talks on Tuesday, with neither side optimistic about the prospects for an agreement that could secure a majority in parliament.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the prime minister’s Brexit negotiator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/27/olly-robbins-steely-operator-fighting-on-the-brexit-frontline\">Olly Robbins</a>, was travelling to Brussels for talks with EU officials on whether the political declaration could be changed, in an effort to break the deadlock.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48262123\">BBC said</a> Robbins would explore how quickly changes could be made to the declaration if the government and Labour could come to an agreement.</p> <p>In a letter to the prime minister, former cabinet ministers including Gavin Williamson, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/01/gavin-williamson-sacked-as-defence-secretary-over-huawei-leak\">sacked </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/01/gavin-williamson-sacked-as-defence-secretary-over-huawei-leak\"> this month</a> over the Huawei leak, the former Brexit secretaries David Davis and Dominic Raab, and the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, cautioned her against any deal involving Corbyn’s central demand of a customs union.</p> <p>“We believe that a customs-union-based deal with Labour will very likely lose the support of Conservative MPs like us who backed the withdrawal agreement in March (in many cases very reluctantly), and you would be unlikely to gain as many Labour MPs to compensate,” said the letter, obtained by <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/youll-split-the-party-top-tories-warn-theresa-may-l83kp06tn\">the Times</a>.</p> <p>“More fundamentally, you would have lost the loyal middle of the Conservative party, split our party and with likely nothing positive to show for it. No leader can bind his or her successor, so the deal would likely be at best temporary, at worst illusory.”</p> <p>The fragility of May’s leadership, and the threat it presents to any deal being deliverable, has been discussed openly in the cross-party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a> talks, which resumed on Monday.</p> <p>Labour is demanding what it calls “entrenchment”, a legal underpinning for any promises made by the prime minister, to prevent a future leader unpicking them. In signing the letter, Johnson and Raab underlined Labour’s fears by making clear they would aim to sweep away any deal that involved a customs union.</p> <p>The presence of Brady’s signature on the letter is also significant, as he is charged with the job of conveying backbenchers’ views to the prime minister. The 1922 Committee’s executive is expected to return for a third time this week to the issue of whether Tory leadership rules should be changed to allow a fresh challenge to the prime minister.</p> <p>May had been keen to table the withdrawal agreement bill (WAB) before the European elections on 23 May, but the mood of Conservative MPs has been hardening against it, even without any customs union concession.</p> <p>A number of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs were already planning to switch back to rejecting May’s deal, adding to the 28 leavers and six remainers from the party who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/29/third-vote-on-may-deal-exposes-splits-among-tory-brexiters\">held out against it last time</a>. Tory MPs said support for May’s deal was “peeling off” as the prime minister’s power was ebbing away and they wanted to show their members and constituents they were serious about a hard Brexit.</p> <p>The Eurosceptic Steve Baker indicated over the weekend that he would stand in the leadership contest if there was no other candidate who clearly opposed the withdrawal agreement, suggesting that Raab and Johnson could be outflanked on the right unless they take a position against it. If Baker does not stand, another of the 28 “Brexit ultras” is likely to put themselves forward.</p> <p>Other Tory MPs suggested that May’s agreement was growing more unpopular daily as polls demonstrated the extent of support for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/13/heidi-allen-challenges-nigel-farage-to-live-tv-debate-before-eu-elections-brexit-party\">Nigel Farage’s Brexit party,</a> which is endorsing a no-deal position.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/13/nigel-farage-brexit-party-event-terrifying-glimpse-future\">'NI-GEL!' Brexit party event offers terrifying glimpse of a possible future | John Crace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Such is the concern about support draining away from the deal that ministers have discussed breaking up the legislation into what one government source called “bite-sized WABs”, in an effort to ratify less controversial aspects.</p> <p>The aim would be to demonstrate some progress in delivering Brexit, ideally before polling day, though ministers are increasingly pessimistic about meeting that deadline. Such a move would probably be regarded with exasperation by Britain’s EU negotiating partners, who signed off on the withdrawal agreement as a package.</p> <p>Cabinet is expected to discuss whether to press ahead with any more Brexit talks with Labour or move to a series of parliamentary votes with a binding outcome – or “definitive votes”.</p> <p>The cross-party negotiations broke up on Monday night with both sides once again signalling no substantive progress had been made.</p> <p>Like May, Corbyn is constrained by his backbenchers. He came under pressure from MPs at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday night over what several claimed was the party’s fuzzy stance on Brexit and lacklustre approach to the European election campaign.</p> <p>The Ilford North MP, Wes Streeting, said: “We’re trying to please everyone and instead are pleasing no one.”</p>",

It refers to the removal, by various means, of students from schools’ records who are deemed too complicated or who don’t make the statistics look good. However, it’s not just education. Off-rolling is common in mental health services and disproportionally affects those most vulnerable and marginalised.</p> <p>Off-rolling takes three main forms. The first is prematurely discharging patients from secondary mental health services such as <a href=\"https://www.rethink.org/diagnosis-treatment/treatment-and-support/cmhts\" title=\"\">community mental health teams</a>. Traditionally, one could expect <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mental-health-treatment-tory-government-nhs-funding-access-work-benefits-a8037331.html\" title=\"\">better care</a> if one had moderate to severe mental health difficulties, as opposed to mild problems, as funding was based on clinical need. However the relentless obsession with <a href=\"https://www.ingentaconnect.com/search/article?option1=tka&amp;value1=the+road+to+hell+is+paved&amp;pageSize=10&amp;index=4\" title=\"\">targets and outcome</a> privileges services that give good optics.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Patients can find their behaviour framed as attention-seeking or manipulative, based more on discrimination than fact</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/mental-health/adults/iapt/\" title=\"\">services</a> for people with mild to moderate problems will always perform better by these kind of metrics of success, as the milder the mental health problems, the quicker and cheaper the treatment, allowing vast numbers to be seen. In this context, secondary services are under huge pressure to produce similar improvements despite <a href=\"https://nhsproviders.org/news-blogs/news/time-to-end-neglect-of-nhs-community-services\" title=\"\">devastating cuts in funding</a>. To manage these expectations, secondary care has re-oriented to a new value – that of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418239/\" title=\"\">recovery</a>, which, as the pioneering mental health survivor-led campaigning group <a href=\"https://recoveryinthebin.org/ritbkeyprinciples/\" title=\"\">Recovery in the Bin</a> demonstrate, has become decoupled from its founding principles to discriminate against people who remain disturbed or unwell.</p> <p>Originally, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11013-019-09623-y\" title=\"\">recovery</a> was an idea arising from the psychiatric survivor movement to trouble the notion that experiences such as <a href=\"https://www.hearing-voices.org/\" title=\"\">hearing voices</a> were essentially pathological, and would necessarily lead to squashed lives consisting only of hospitalisations and despair. However, while there are excellent examples of recovery-oriented services in the NHS, recovery principles are used increasingly to justify discharging patients who clinicians, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/nhs-staff-are-burning-out-heres-how-to-make-it-stop-84746\" title=\"\">themselves under huge pressure</a>, know are not functioning well in the community or would never be able to.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/oct/02/newly-discharged-mental-health-patients-at-much-higher-risk-of-death\">Newly discharged mental health patients at much higher risk of death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Discharge is now common if patients are ambivalent about the care options available or struggle to attend appointments, though this is often as a result of the very mental health problems these services are designed to treat. <a href=\"https://recoveryinthebin.org/2019/04/26/what-is-recovery-who-defines-it-why-am-i-unrecovered/\" title=\"\">“Failing”</a> to show an improvement after treatment is also seen as a legitimate reason for discharge even when evidence-based alternatives have not been offered; keeping someone relatively stable through ongoing support has been downgraded, foreclosing <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/mental-health-treatment-tory-government-nhs-funding-access-work-benefits-a8037331.html\" title=\"\">the reality of long-term need</a> and the catastrophic decline that can occur when this is removed.</p> <p>Patients with serious mental health problems are discharged in a way that was unthinkable five, let alone 15 years ago, sometimes without warning. Carers, activists, police and GPs are often left desperately trying to link the person back into mental health services. Sometimes this will succeed, though often via a traumatic experience such as being sectioned. For others, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/05/hundreds-of-mental-health-patients-dying-after-nhs-care-failures\" title=\"\">it is too late</a>.</p> <p>The second form of off-rolling is labelling people as having a personality disorder, <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-jay-watts/borderline-personality-di_b_12167212.html?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAMPOzgWYL4reMjZpk8yhQRoyiXbYSf27bz3YLgzlj_dgVtY_9liqG3kQXQ-KVzQdNP7Rabf3w_O6fdKfO-57kYgC16y3f6jutO2jfCFlZrBgdER5NUcubNJsGzvl_2K4TvFI4j3XUssyvC-ntGVhUuo8e1jaaHSjWcfADxEcwVHI&amp;guccounter=2\" title=\"\">most often borderline personality disorder</a>.

These kind of reactions are <a href=\"https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/40036/1/bpd-borderline-personality-disorder-diagnosis-label\" title=\"\">nearly always very sensible responses</a> to a lack of decent care and containment either from the NHS and/or from early caregivers and society at large. Yet the reaction this label elicits is often not compassion or reflection but <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-42647972\" title=\"\">exclusion</a> on the grounds that crisis care, inpatient care and so on are not good for the patient in some way. Instead, patients can suddenly find their behaviour framed as <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/dr-jay-watts/borderline-personality-di_b_12167212.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKJhHH381RlUJIHhrB-caHzncuKctmqPYtiM1xgjrTXxtV07iIGc1WiZXTouCaN2CnqYDaYztyLC1GkKgg_1v4dPB9MZIAiulif5eyVm2tagm8ZjZRRG1jLJkxnq79RoGy5edXdRvDjhFy3LFHavkrBKwO1zkAXrQTn4kgQ4jg83\" title=\"\">attention-seeking or manipulative</a>, an idea based more on discrimination than fact.</p> <p>The third most common form of off-rolling is sending patients with complex needs to out-of-area beds often provided by for-profit providers. There are huge problems with this: the least of which is the excessive cost to the public purse. For not only is <a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/health/anorexia-claire-greaves-death-eating-16070648\" title=\"\">the distance from home</a>, often for months or years, a risk factor for death by suicide but these out-of-sight-out-of-mind patients are sometimes subject to draconian levels of <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-47774872\" title=\"\">seclusion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/cygnet-health-care\" title=\"\">physical restraint</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cqc.org.uk/sites/default/files/20170720_stateofmh_report.pdf\" title=\"\">ward restriction</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/may/10/one-in-four-teachers-in-england-say-they-have-witnessed-off-rolling\">One in four teachers say pupils are being forced out to boost school rankings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At present, there are no national figures available on discharge from community mental health services – when it happens and why; whether adequate support in the community is on offer; whether discharge from mainstream services to the waiting lists of specialist services is based on a real prospect of care in the near future, or leaves vulnerable patients with nothing, and so on.

Richer, who recently turned 60, said the “time was right” to pass the baton to the chain’s 531 employees.</p> <p>“My father dropped down dead at 60 so I am very keen for this to happen in my lifetime,” explained Richer. “I felt the time was right, rather than leaving it until I’m not around, to ensure the transition goes smoothly and I can be part of it. I still really, really care but it is time for the next generation.”</p> <p>The company will pay Richer an initial £9.2m for the stake but the businessman is giving £3.5m of that back to staff, who will receive £1,000 for every year they have worked for the retailer.</p> <p>The average payout will be £8,000 but there are 39 employees with more than 20 years’ service who stand to receive substantial windfalls. The company’s nine directors, who Richer said earn six-figure salaries, are not included in the bonus pool: “This is to thank loyal, hardworking colleagues.”</p> <p>With annual sales of nearly £200m, Richer Sounds is one of the biggest UK companies to embrace employee ownership in recent years.</p> <p>The Employee Ownership Association (EOA) says more than 350 businesses have now adopted the model, with at least 50 more preparing to follow suit. Recent converts include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/07/riverford-organic-veg-employee-ownership-plan\">Riverford, the organic vegetable box company</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/10/wallace-gromit-producers-hand-stake-in-business-to-staff\">Aardman</a>, the Bristol-based animation studio behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wallace-and-gromit\">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>.</p> <p>An unorthodox business figure, with his long hair and sideline as the drummer in funk band Ten Millennia, Richer is lauded for the success of Richer Sounds which he founded in 1978 at the age of 19. His business philosophy, set out in his 2001 management book The Richer Way, champions providing secure, well-paid jobs with a happy workforce as being key to business success over the long term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a235c12570d9fe3aa853aba5a3dfc650e9efcdb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a235c12570d9fe3aa853aba5a3dfc650e9efcdb7/0_116_5453_3271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richer Sounds store\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richer Sounds has 53 stores, including this outlet in Bromley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UrbanImages/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Richer Sounds, which has 53 stores, refuses to use zero-hours contracts and is one of the 14% of companies with a pay gap that favours women. Employee perks include access to company holiday homes around the world, including in European cities such as Paris, Venice and Barcelona. It donates 15% of profits, which last year stood at £9.6m, to charity.</p> <p>Richer will stay on as managing director for the time being. Day-to-day operations are already overseen by the chief executive, Julie Abraham, who will eventually succeed him. Richer and the retailer’s chairman David Robinson are two of four trustees of the newly established Richer Sounds Trust.</p> <p>Robinson, who has worked for the company for 35 years, said the ownership change would make colleagues feel even more connected to the company: “They have a real stake in the success of the business and can take pride in knowing they are shareholders, building for the future.”</p> <p>Richer, who has no children, had written the plan into his will but began preparations two years ago to avoid his wife Rosie having to oversee the process. “I think it’s the adult thing to do and, psychologically, passing control is important because I’ve been on this gold-plated treadmill for 40 years,” he said.</p> <p>The trust will operate according to a set of principles designed to ensure it continues to follow the course set by Richer over the past 40 years. A colleague advisory council will be established to represent the interests of employees and shape the company’s future.</p> <p>Richer said the arrangement meant the company would avoid an “aggressive” outside investor “changing the strategy”.</p> <p>If Richer Sounds continues to be successful Richer will receive additional payments over a 15 year period but would have raked in more cash if he had hoisted a for sale sign. His 100% ownership accounted for just over half his £160m fortune in the annual Rich List survey.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>“I feel an incredible loyalty to my hard working colleagues and they should receive any benefit from running the business once my time is up as opposed to just selling to the highest bidder,” said Richer. “They know the business, and especially our rather unusual culture, extremely well, and the business is therefore far more likely to flourish under their own steam because of this.”</p> <p>The changes at Richer Sounds do not mean the Yorkshire-based entrepreneur, who is currently advising Marks &amp; Spencer on how to change its dysfunctional business culture, is about to retire.</p> <p>He is financing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/27/julian-richer-crusade-expose-tax-avoiders-richer-sounds\">Taxwatch</a>, a non-profit organisation which pores over the opaque finances of multinational companies, and is considering funding a test case against zero-hours contracts.</p> <p>The EOA chief executive, Deb Oxley, suggested employee ownership was reaching a tipping point: “We’re delighted to see Richer Sounds secure its future independence with a focus on its people and an eye on the future world – a world with a more inclusive economy and where more businesses are a force for good.”</p> <h2>What is employee ownership?</h2> <p>Employee-owned businesses are entirely or significantly owned by their workforce. Shares can be held by individuals or collectively through an employee trust – or a mixture of both. A company will also have a mechanism to represent their views, such as a council, board or employee representative. Decisions are still made by a board but employees have a say on operational and strategic matters. The model is said to allow companies to plan investment and growth over a longer horizon rather than having to satisfy the short-term demands of external shareholders.</p> <h2>Other examples of employee-owned companies</h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/johnlewis\">John Lewis Partnership</a>, which owns the eponymous department stores and Waitrose, is the UK’s biggest employee-owned business with 83,900 employees or “partners”. Pioneering businessman John Spedan Lewis signed away his ownership rights in 1929 to allow future generations to take forward an “experiment in industrial democracy”.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/07/riverford-organic-veg-employee-ownership-plan\">Riverford Organic Farmers</a> made the switch last year when founder Guy Singh-Watson gave over a 76% stake to a trust. Its 650 employees will share 10% of annual profits generated by the £60m turnover business, which delivers nearly 50,000 boxes of produce a week. The company is paying Singh-Watson £6m over four years.</p> <p>Last year the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/10/wallace-gromit-producers-hand-stake-in-business-to-staff\">owners of Aardman</a>, the Bristol-based animation studio behind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/wallace-and-gromit\">Wallace &amp; Gromit</a>, Shaun the Sheep and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/28/how-we-made-morph-peter-lord-david-sproxton\">Morph</a>, used a trust to pass a 75% stake to 140 employees and freelancers. The move was designed to protect the company’s independence and its animators will continue to receive a share of profits.</p> <p>Employees of 134 year-old Essex jam-maker Wilkin &amp; Sons own almost half the company through a trust. Many staff live in company accommodation on the estate surrounding the Tiptree factory, with trading profits used to buy back shares for the trust. Profits also go to support local projects including sports and arts organisations.</p>",

It ran its course a long time ago. As it is Mental Health Awareness Week, the best thing ITV can do is announce it is no longer commissioning the show.”</p> <p>Walker described it as “an unattractive form of television, based on the bullying of the weak and vulnerable”, adding the show’s format is “not compatible with a responsible society and a responsible broadcaster”.</p> <p>He added: “I do think the Jeremy Kyle show and those involved will feel a sense of responsibility and a sense of grief, clearly not on the same scale as this man’s family. As human beings with their own family, perhaps now they will decide this too can’t continue.”.</p> <p>Damian Collins, the chairman of the Commons digital, culture, media and sport committee, said TV companies “have a duty to care for the people who take part in their programmes”, while the Conservative MP Simon Hart, who also sits on the committee, described the show as “car-crash TV which revels in people’s terrible misfortune and sometimes their vulnerabilities”.</p> <p>Honey Langcaster-James, a TV psychologist who has worked on ITV shows including Love Island, said: “I think that the format of the Jeremy Kyle Show is one that we could and should be moving away from.”</p> <p>She added: “It is possible to make entertaining TV that does not revolve around the potential humiliation of guests who are suffering from a variety of difficulties, such as addiction.”</p> <p>The behavioural psychologist Jo Hemmings, who has worked for shows including Big Brother, said it was time for ITV to decommission the programme. “It’s an archaic kind of show, it probably was when it was first commissioned, but now it seems very out of step with our attitude with mental health issues.”</p> <p>Callaghan said Dymond had been “quietly struggling”, but praised the show’s team for their after-care efforts. She told the Sun: “They were brilliant. They were there when he needed help. They were really persistent in offering him help.”</p> <p>Callaghan said that shortly before they went on the show, Dymond had convinced her he had not cheated, but the pair split up afterwards.</p> <p>ITV did not show Monday morning’s episode and has wiped all previous episodes from its on-demand service, the ITV Hub. They will also not be shown on ITV2.</p> <p>A celebrity edition starring the former X Factor contestant Christopher Maloney and ex-EastEnders actor Danniella Westbrook was due to air on Tuesday, but will be rescheduled, according to both.</p> <p>The broadcaster said the episode featuring the participant who died would be submitted for a review due to the “seriousness of this event”.</p> <p>In the talkshow, which has had a regular daytime morning slot on ITV since 2005, host Kyle and psychotherapist Graham Stanier help the guests talk through their personal issues in front of a studio audience.</p> <p>In 2014, the regulator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/apr/14/jeremy-kyle-teenager-distressed-itv\">Ofcom criticised the show</a> for not doing enough to prevent the distress and humiliation of a 17-year-old guest who was called a “crackhead” and a “silly anorexic slapper” by her older sister.</p> <p><em>• In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a>.

Politicians in the US have alleged that Huawei’s forthcoming 5G mobile phone networks could be hacked by Chinese spies to eavesdrop on sensitive phone calls and gain access to counter-terrorist operations. Allies who allow Huawei technology inside their 5G networks have been told they may be frozen out of US intelligence sharing. Australia, New Zealand and Japan have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/19/where-huawei-is-banned\">banned Huawei from their 5G networks</a>.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, BT has excluded Huawei telecoms infrastructure from its own 5G rollout and removed some of its equipment from the 4G network. In January 2019 Vodafone said it had decided to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/25/vodafone-pauses-huawei-equipment-core-network-across-europe-security-concerns\">'pause' the use of Huawei equipment</a>&nbsp;in its core networks across Europe.

His daughter, Huawei’s senior executive Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December 2018 over allegations of Iran-sanctions violations, and she awaits extradition to the US. Ren, referring to trade issues between the US and China, says the company is 'like a small sesame seed, stuck in the middle of conflict between two great powers'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Shortly afterwards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/02/gavin-williamson-hits-back-at-haphazard-leak-inquiry\">Gavin Williamson was fired as defence secretary</a> after being accused by the prime minister of being behind the leak.</p> \n<p>Critics of the decision in the UK have pointed to a 2017 Chinese intelligence law that requires companies to cooperate with the country’s government if required, and say Huawei could be forced to comply with surveillance demands.</p> \n<p>Asked about the law in an interview on the BBC’s Today programme, Watkins said that “all countries have a similar kind of law” when asked about its potential impact – and later observed “there has never been a request” made under its provisions.</p> \n<p>Senior Huawei executives including the company’s chairman, Liang Hua, have come to the UK for a long-arranged meeting with suppliers and partners, where they are also lobbying to be allowed to supply kit for mobile phone networks.</p> \n<p>A report from Oxford Economics, commissioned by the company, claimed Huawei had directly contributed £287m to the UK economy by 2018, and that when the contribution of its suppliers and employees was added that took the total to £1.7bn. It employs 1,600 people in the UK, having supplied equipment in the country since 2001.</p> \n<p>But Sir Michael Fallon, a former defence secretary, said the UK should <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/26/huawei-leak-inquiry-philip-hammond-national-security-council\">“take account of American warnings”</a> and ban Huawei entirely. “It’s very dangerous letting Huawei into the infrastructure of our next generation networks,” he said.</p> \n<p>British intelligence agencies led by GCHQ have argued that any risks from Huawei can be contained – a special unit dubbed “the Cell” exists to monitor the company’s software to ensure it cannot be exploited. Theresa May followed their advice at the controversial NSC meeting.</p> \n<p>However, Fallon, echoing the US concerns, said he believed such confidence was misplaced. “I don’t see the distinction between so-called core and so-called edge. That’s the view that the US and Australia have taken and it would be a great mistake to be out of line with our allies.”</p> \n<p>Last week Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, argued for a total ban on Huawei. “Ask yourself: would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/09/thatcher-and-the-magic-acorn-iron-ladys-use-of-dubious-remedies-revealed\">the Iron Lady</a> be silent when China violates the sovereignty of nations through corruption or coercion?”</p>",

We will also be polling local authorities to understand how any potential review of these powers may look in future.”</p> <p>New guidance will be issued to mitigate against any discrepancies in enforcement across the UK, with some council’s expected to be more proactive than others.</p>",

          "body": "<p>I am a 55-year-old man who has eaten no meat or meat products for six years (for welfare reasons) until recently. During this period I have regularly purchased Tesco raspberry and white chocolate meal replacement bars. But Tesco has recently <a href=\"https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/products/302932374\" title=\"\">replaced the product</a>. I have just eaten a new bar and found to my horror that it now contains beef, whereas the previous product had no beef. I last purchased the old product at the end of March when it was £3.60 for three, but now it is £4 for four – although the weight of each bar is the same at 60g. The old product was “ultra slim” while the replacement is “slim”. Beef is disclosed in the small print ingredients list – allergens are highlighted, but meat isn’t. Tesco customer services offered a refund and £10 for the upset, which I think is an insult.</p> <p>GL, <em>Shrewsbury, Shropshire</em></p> <p> We felt your pain but are tempted to proffer the “should have gone to Specsavers” advice. We double-checked with Tesco which said this product has always contained beef. It says: “We work hard to make our food labelling clear and comply with all regulations and legal requirements, so are sorry to hear of GL’s concerns. We clearly label all our vegetarian products and this one has never had the ‘suitable for vegetarians’ logo on the packaging.”</p> <p>It makes the refund and offer of £10 look generous …</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

          "body": "<p>The first flaws in the new immigration scheme for EU citizens who want to remain in the UK after Brexit have been exposed after a couple who live in Oxford were blocked from getting a flight back from Turkey to the UK.</p> <p>Arthur Vissing, a Danish citizen, and his Turkish wife, Ezgi Vissing, called on the government to urgently review its procedures to allow those who hold residency rights in the UK to travel unhindered.</p> <p>Their ordeal started last Thursday at Istanbul airport when British Airways told them a number of times Ezgi did not have the right paperwork to get on the flight.</p> <p>It took 24 hours, seven phone calls to the Home Office and others and the intervention of their Liberal Democrat MP, Layla Moran, before BA let them on the plane.</p> <p>Non-EU spouses are entitled to travel and reside with their EU national husband or wife in another member state under EU freedom of movement laws but, under the UK’s post-Brexit plans, EU citizens and their family members must apply for “settled status”.</p> <p>BA said it was only following instructions from Border Force in the Vissings’ case, but Ezgi said she got a blank look or negative response when she explained the new immigration system in place for EU citizens.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EzgiVissing/status/1126932464759377920\">tweet</a> posted as she was trying to get the situation resolved, she said: “I was asked time and time again if I held a UK visa. I said I held a pre-settled status. The officer, then, seemed puzzled by the very concept. I was advised by the @ukhomeoffice that my status would be checked on the screen automatically.”</p> <p>She claims she was threatened with removal from the airport when she asked to see a manager to explain why she thought the check-in staff were wrong to refuse her a boarding card. “I got a very harsh reaction,” she said. “So we sat on the floor making phone calls to the Home Office to try and sort this out.”</p> <p>Overnight, they tried but failed to get proof of their rights from the Home Office, leaving them concerned that Ezgi would not be able to get back to Oxford, where she has lived for six years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EzgiVissing/status/1126746956896686080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/the3million?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@the3million</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ukhomeoffice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ukhomeoffice</a>&#39;s &quot;EU Settlement Scheme&quot; doesn&#39;t work. I am NOT allowed to cross the border in Turkey although I DO hold a pre-settled status. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/British_Airways?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@British_Airways</a>, advised by the British Consulate in Istanbul, is refusing to use the online verification system.</p>&mdash; Ezgi Vissing (@EzgiVissing) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EzgiVissing/status/1126746956896686080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 10, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On a scale of one to 10 in terms of stress, Arthur put the experience at nine. “You feel like you are losing the most fundamental thing in life, the right to have a family life, the right to have the person who is closest to you to live in the same country as you,” he said.</p> <p>Ezgi said she found the 24 hours very distressing. “Arthur managed it better than me; he was trying to make me laugh, keep my spirits up. I was in tears most of the time. I would not like to go through it again and would not like any EU citizen or their families to go through this,” she said.</p> <p>The campaign group for EU citizens, <a href=\"https://www.the3million.org.uk/\">the3million</a>, said the case was proof that EU citizens needed physical documents and not a webpage on a Home Office site as evidence of their rights.</p> <p>“The Home Office is promising us a lifetime of worries by refusing to issue EU citizens who successfully applied for settled status a secured physical document,” said Nicolas Hatton, the group’s co-founder. “It would reassure the elderly who don’t use online services and those who worry about returning to their home in the UK from a holiday, but not able to because the system is down.”</p> <p>Ezgi had been so wary of having to prove her rights to travel before the trip that she had not left the country since the referendum three years ago. It was only after the government announced the settled status scheme for EU citizens and their families that she felt it would be safe to go abroad.</p> <p>She had hoped to travel to Istanbul for a friend’s wedding and carry out research for her doctorate at Oxford University and had been assured in telephone calls to the Home Office that her new ID would be released on time for her trip on 2 May.</p> <p>As part of the application as a non-EU national, she was also required to have her fingerprints taken in Croydon and the first appointment available was on 9 April, which is when things started to go awry. With just a week before her flight, the Home Office told her she had been “downgraded” to pre-settled status for people in the country fewer than five years.</p> <p>“This was very odd because I had been in the country over five years but also because they said they would reset the clock and it would be another six to nine days before they would release the pre-settled status,” she said. “I don’t think it was a coincidence they told me this on 9 April, the day I had my fingerprints taken.”</p> <p>They made four calls to the Home Office before travelling and took a copy of their marriage certificate with them to prove their rights, but to no avail.</p> <p>“I offered the check-in staff the printouts of the gov.uk webpage with a link to my case. They said they wanted to help me but they couldn’t do anything. They said this was the advice given by the liaison officer in Heathrow and by the British consulate,” said Ezgi.</p> <p>Nicolas Rollason, a partner at Kingsley Napley law firm, said the Vissings had come up against a “longstanding” difference in treatment of family members of EU nationals from countries who require visas to visit the UK and those who do not, such as US citizens.</p> <p>Americans can board flights and be “re-admitted at the border as a matter of course” but airlines often refuse other non-EU nationals “even if they have the required proof of the status as an EU family member”.</p> <p>Rollason added:“The Home Office should work more closely with the airlines and ensure that all carriers have clear lines of communication with UK immigration for getting pre-boarding clearance and help travellers on their journeys in these circumstances.”</p> <p>A spokesman for BA said it was Border Force and not the airline that issued the instructions to prevent Ezgi from boarding the flight.</p> <p>The Home Office said the individual had travelled without documentation and had been advised to apply for a biometric card. Ezgi pointed out they had done that and it was that application that appeared to have caused the delay in getting settled status.</p> <p>“We have been able to assist an individual with the right to enter the country, but who did not have the necessary documentation with them to travel to the UK,” said a spokesman.</p> <p>The Home Office said it had given as much help as was possible and at the time of travel Ezgi’s application was still pending. She did not travel with a biometric card, as advised by officials, before her outward journey, the Home Office added.</p>",
